We envision a future Web3 coordinate their activities such as fundraising, product building and hiring through a web3 ecosystem that provides entreprenuers an access to decentralized networks and collective intelligence.

One of the most significant impact areas is how the work is geeting done. So far founders had a horrible task to manually and linearly find investors, do the paperwork and many other mundane tasks. Similarly building a product has been associated with first getting the funds, then building a necessary organization through a painstaking and slow hiring process.

Our mission at AISure is to disrupt how startups operate by harnessing the power of decentralized networks and collective integlligence in the web3 ecosystem.We create a web2 ecosysem where the limists of a centralized company as a cooridination mechanism are replaced with decentralized contribute-to-earn and work-to-earn organizational models.

AISure ecosystem, entreprenuers willl be able to immediately publish a development contract and let the community of experts collectively join forces and build the product. This concepts is similar to a marketplace but with significantly lower coordination costs, completely automated processes and the power of collective intelligence. Moreover, the fundraising process will be completely automated and founders can raise from as many investors as they wish without worrying about time and costs.

There is an incredible potential for founders to harness the power of decentralized networks and people's collective intelligence, and we are building the infrastrcuture for that offer.

We aim to provide founders with all the necessary tools to easily fundraise from a large number of investors and build products by leveraging the collective intelligence.

Our first two products are the Builder and the Customer Builder is changing the way how founders build and launch their products by integrating no-code and Web3 technologies, a pool of pre-vetted developers and a decentralized workforce organization and coordination mechanism.

Customer is a fundraising tool for founders who aim to spend less time raising money and more time on buiilding a business. It is the easiest way to automate fundraising from A to Z, keep track of the process and turn a community into your cap table.
